Problem:

- build a wall full of concrete with dimensions l = 1 m, w= 0.5 m, h = 2 m, make the volume sensitive

- generate a beam of 10 GeV neutrons directed along -z axis:
o from the point (0,0, 3 m)
o make the beam pencil-like with a cross section of radius 1 cm

- lower the energy to 1 GeV, 100 MeV, 10 MeV 

- change the particles
