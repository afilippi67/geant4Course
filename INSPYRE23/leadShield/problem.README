Problem:

- build a shield of Lead with dimensions l = 1 m, w = 5 mm, h = 2 m, put its center at  (10, 10, 40) cm make the volume sensitive

- generate a beam of 10 GeV neutrons directed along +z axis:
o from the point (0,0,0) m
o make the beam pencil-like with a cross section of radius 1 cm
o generate one event at a time

- lower the energy to 1 GeV, 100 MeV, 10 MeV 

- change the beam particle to gamma of 100 KeV (typical X-rays for diagnostic usage)
