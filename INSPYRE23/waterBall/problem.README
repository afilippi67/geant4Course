Problem:

- build a sphere full of water with radius 5 cm, make the volume sensitive

- generate a beam of 1 GeV protons directed along -z axis:
o from (0,0,0)
o from the point (0,0, 1 m)
o make the beam pencil-like with a cross section of radius 5 mm
o start again from (0,0,0) and make the source isotropical
