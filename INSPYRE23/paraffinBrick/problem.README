Problem:

- build a brick of paraffine with dimensions l = 20 cm, w= 10 cm, h = 30 cm, make the volume sensitive

- generate a beam of 10 GeV neutrons directed along -z axis:
o from the point (0,0, 2 m)
o make the beam pencil-like with a cross section of radius 1 cm

- use the low energy physics set: EMZ + QGSP_BIC_HP

- lower the energy to 1 GeV, 100 MeV, 10 MeV down to 1 MeV

- fine the minimum energy to stop all neutrons

- repeat with e-
