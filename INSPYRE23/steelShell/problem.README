Problem:

- build a hollow sphere of steel with radius 5 cm, thickness 5 mm, make the 
volume sensitive
- fill the hollow part of the sphere with air, make the volume sensitive

- generate a beam of 1 GeV protons 
o isotropically emitted  from the center of the sphere
o emitted from the point (0., 0., 20 cm) towards -z

- fill the hollow with Helium or vacuum G4_Galactic


- change the particles and see what happens! try with 1 GeV
o electrons
o photons
o positrons
